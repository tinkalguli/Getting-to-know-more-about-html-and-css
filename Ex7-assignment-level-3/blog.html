          <h2>Art education during the COVID-19 lockdown</h2>
          <p>Prior to COVID-19 restrictions, art teachers were already well accustomed to working with multi-modalities across the spectrum of visual art media. These ways of working are informed by teachers’ own deep engagements with art, be it through their own art making, or their responding and making meaning from artworks encountered in their classrooms and the community.</p>
          <p>The places and means through which these practical meaning-making encounters occur in 2020 remains in flux, and visual arts teachers across Australia are navigating this uncertainty in distinctive, interconnected and expansive ways.</p>
          <h3>Examples of innovation in practice</h3>
          <p>During March and April in Australia, artists and visual arts educators have been visionary in transforming their ways of connecting and communicating with their students and each other.</p>
          <p>A scroll through the social and news feeds of artists and educators provides a compelling picture of artists and educators across the country innovating to share practice with their colleagues. Australian arts educators responded quickly to meet the need for creative, collaborative and critical engagement opportunities for students’ visual art learning at home; catering for online, offline and off device needs. Provided appropriate measures were put in place to enable equitable access to digital technology, there were plenty of examples of practitioners who demonstrated an aptitude for teaching in creative ways to accommodate individual student needs and circumstances.</p>

          <h2>Using research to inform student welfare programs</h2>
          <p>As a Year 8 Advisor at a secondary school in New South Wales, David Williams works with students on their welfare and social and emotional development and is always seeking resources related to these topics.</p>
          <p>Williams is also an HSIE (Human Society and Its Environment) educator at Rouse Hill Anglican College, where they value integrating student welfare in an academic context. Williams subscribes to Teacher magazine’s free weekly email bulletin and says it is a source of inspiration for the student welfare programs he leads.</p>
          <h3>Broadening your evidence base</h3>
          <p>When the Teacher bulletin arrives in his inbox, Williams is often most interested in the articles and infographics related to his role in student welfare.</p>
          <p>‘What my inevitable process is, I’ll get the email and I’ll just look at one thing that’s interesting and that speaks to me. So it’ll be a topic that I’d been thinking about already, or it’ll be something connected to welfare, or it’ll be something connected to raising boys, or teacher burnout, even differentiation,’ he shares.</p>
          <p>‘I’ve always found the articles in Teacher magazine … quite accessible and helpful and meaningful,’ he says. ‘Information has been sourced that I haven’t had to go and get, and therefore it broadens my view without me having to go out and find a bunch of things.’</p>
          <h3>Understanding wellbeing concerns of students</h3>
          <p>A recent example he recalls is accessing infographics on the topic of student welfare in schools.</p>
          <p>‘Through the infographic it helps me understand, what are the most pressing needs of students? Where do they suffer more? Or what sort of areas are problems arising [from] more than others? And then it gives me my talking points for my students.’</p>
          <p>Often this means Williams will reference infographics or articles in weekly meetings he has with students, where he makes a short presentation to talk about welfare.</p>
          <p>As well as this, the school nominates a goal or value to work on with students each term. This could be one of the college’s core values like respect or honesty, Williams explains, and a group session is held every two weeks to work with students on a topic that is related to the overall goal or value.</p>
